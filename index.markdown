        <h2>Empowering Users to Innovate</h2>
        <p>
          Open source and community-driven software development is becoming increasingly important to the wireless
          industry. The world is becoming more and more connected,
          from intelligent homes to autonomous vehicles and smart cities. Open source
          software is helping spur the creativity and innovation that will allow these
          devices to better support their users and provide even greater value. In recognition of this market dynamic,
          Qualcomm formed the the Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC).
