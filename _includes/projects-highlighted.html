    <p class="quic-project-description">
      Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) is at the forefront of enabling low-power inference at the edge through its
      pioneering model-efficiency research. QuIC has a mission to help migrate the ecosystem toward fixed-point
      inference. With this goal, QuIC presents the AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) - a library that provides
      advanced quantization and compression techniques for trained neural network models. AIMET enables neural networks
      to run more efficiently on fixed-point AI hardware accelerators.

    <p class="quic-project-description">The AIMET Model Zoo is a collection of popular pre-trained models optimized for
      8-bit inference. It also provides the recipe for quantizing popular 32-bit floating point (FP32) models to 8-bit
      integer (INT8) models with little loss in accuracy. The tested and verified recipes include a script that
      optimizes TensorFlow or PyTorch models across a broad range of categories from image classification, object
      detection, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation to super resolution, and speech recognition.
